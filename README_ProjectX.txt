I tried installing ROS on Windows, but ended up with a lot of errors. I did leanr about system variables, and how you can make changes to the paths. Finally, after 1 day of trouble, I gave up, will try later.

Took help of chatgpt and comet for writing my 5 IR line follower bot. I learnt about PID and how it is used to correct errors in our bot. PID seems useful as of now. I learnt about the working of a line follower bot. 
It seems like an easy-to-understand topic. 

I learnt about the Dijkstra( or something like that spelling) Algorithm for maze solving. It used Breadth first search graph traversing algorithm, which appears to be less efficient that depth search first. Although, I dont understand 
how such an algorithm is considered efficient. It does not seem like it can solve our problem of maze solving. Atleast not efficeintly.
